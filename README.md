# Here I Create a Testimonial Quats Generator Using Array

```
Welcome to My Github Profile.
as I create a simple Testimonial Generator from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
```
This code creates a testimonial generator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It defines an array of testimonial objects, each containing an image, quote, and author. The updateTestimonial function retrieves the testimonial information from the array and updates the HTML elements to display the current testimonial's image, quote, and author. The code uses object destructuring to extract the properties from the testimonial object and assigns them to the corresponding HTML elements. The i index is incremented to iterate through the testimonial array, and if it reaches the array's length, it resets to 0 for continuous looping of testimonials. Overall, this code provides a dynamic way to showcase testimonials on a website or application.
